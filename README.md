This project is a command-line RSS feeder developed on Ruby.

It fetches and displayes the latest news articles from an RSS feed.
Users can input a custom RSS feed URL
or use the default IGN Articles RSS feed.

The project utilizes Ruby and the 'rss' and 'open-uri' libraries
to provide a simple way to stay updated with news headlines.

To use it simply install the gem bundle and run the main.rb on your terminal.
